/// For example, a check elimination optimization can implement it to filter out
/// checks that can never fail at runtime. Check optimizations that require
/// bounds information from the instrumentation can require them through this
/// interface, filter out instrumentation checks, and place their own checks.
/// Another use case is the optimization of metadata propagation of the
/// instrumentation.

/// \brief Interface to implement when designing optimizations
///
/// In a module pass, inherit from this interface to implement optimizations
/// in the meminstrument pipeline. The pass has to be required by the
/// MemInstrumentPass.
///
/// An optimizations that proves checks redundant can simply remove ITargets
/// in the updateITargetForFunction() method, and no instrumentation is placed
/// for the filtered target. In addition, the functions declared here allow to
/// require explicit bound values for memory regions from the run-time system
/// and to use them. This is useful to generate own checks at preferred
/// program locations. At the point where
/// materializeExternalChecksForFunction() is called, these bounds are
/// available to the optimization, and checks can be generated.
///
/// These functions can be called by the meminstrument pass (when given
/// appropriate cli flags). They are then executed at the following positions
/// in the pipeline:
///
///  +-----------------+
///  | prepareModule() |
///  +-----------------+
///           ||
